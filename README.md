# eagle-library-of-most-popular-lorawan-modules
Since Autodesk's library.io hasn't got the feature to publish my managed libary I share my library here. 

### How to use:
* Copy the library (with .lbr extension) to the where they are stored by Eagle. It is usually the following on Windows: C:\Users\<username>\Documents\EAGLE\libraries
* After this open the Library Manager. From the available tab select the desired library and click on the Use button
* Now you can add a module with the add tool...

### The list of modules:
* Microchip RN2483 / RN2903
* Murata Type ABZ
